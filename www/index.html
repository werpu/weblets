<div class="app"><p>Component libraries for web application frameworks often need to provide resource files along with
    implementation classes. For example, JavaServer Faces Renderers often need JavaScript, CSS and image resources.</p>

    <p>Although dropping in an implementation JAR does make these components libraries available, the resource files
        must be extracted into the web application root. This can easily lead to inconsistency problems between
        implementation code and resource files.</p>

    <p>Weblets aims to solve this problem, without placing undue burden on the application developer. Although
        JavaServer Faces is mentioned as an explicit example, Weblets aims to solve the general problem in a
        non-Faces-specific way, and then provide an integration with Faces.</p>

    <p>The Weblets project was born during our book research for an easy way of loading resources directly out of JAR.
        The book is now available - <a href="http://www.apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=10044">Pro JSF and Ajax:
        Building Rich Internet Components</a>, and the Weblets project is an important part of this work. The Weblets
        source has been available since Dec 4th. We will also be uploading collateral and samples as soon as possible.

    <h3>News Update<br/></h3>

    <p>After being quiet for a while here a short news update regarding Weblets.</p>

    <p> &nbsp; A wiki has been opened you can reach it <a title="Weblets Wiki"
                                                          href="http://wiki.java.net/bin/view/Projects/Weblets">here</a>,
        currently not too much information is in there, due to the fact<br/>that most of the information I have are
        written directly in the docs, but every Wiki lives from the contributions of the end user,<br/>so your
        information is vital.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Also Weblets has not been on a hiatus, development has been going on the last months. There will be a 1.1 version
        soon (I am close to a first beta). For more information about the planned features, visit the <a
            title="Weblets Wiki" href="http://wiki.java.net/bin/view/Projects/Weblets">Wiki</a> or ask in the users
        mailing list.</p>
