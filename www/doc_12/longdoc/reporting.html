                    <p>Reporting is a general problem within the domain of web applications. Usually three Methods of
                        reporting are applied within a web application.</p>
                    <ol type="1">
                        <li>On demand reporting, reports are generated on demand within a request.</li>
                        <li>In Server Reporting, reports are generated within a single server but may be generated
                            asynchronously within a separated reporting task.
                        </li>
                        <li>Stand alone reporting server. The reports are generated within a separated reporting server,
                            which runs in its own process space!
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>All of the above mentioned methods can be covered by <tt>Weblets</tt>
                        via separate access methods!</p>

                    <div class="section"><h3>On Demand Reporting</h3>

                        <p>The easiest method, basically an on demand report, is generated on the fly within a single
                            request.</p>
                        <img src="../images/weblets-reporting-1.png" alt="<i>Figure 1.: On Demand Reporting</i>
"/>

                        <p>As we can see in <tt>Figure 1</tt>
                            <tt>Weblets</tt>
                            supports this reporting case with its own frontend apis. <tt>Weblets</tt>
                            always serves a valid URL String to the resource, which then can be processed by the
                            standard java URL api of Java for further processing.</p>

                        <p>The following picture displays the execution flow for this reporting case:</p>
                        <img src="../images/weblets-reporting-2.png" alt="<i>Figure 2. On Demand Reporting Workflow</i>
"/>

                        <p>As displayed, only the calls to the frontend API are utilized. The other parts are pure Java
                            calls!! To enable the reporting capabilities in this case the <tt>WebletUtils</tt>
                            class can be used with its helper methods.</p>

                        <div class="source"><pre>
        WebletUtils.getResource(&lt;webletname&gt;, &lt;resource&gt;)
        WebletUtils.getURL(&lt;webletname&gt;, &lt;resource&gt;)
</pre>
                        </div>

                            for further descriptions.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="section"><h3>In Server Reporting</h3>

                        <div class="section"><h4>Introduction</h4>

                            <p><b>In server reporting</b>
                                is a common reporting case. Longer running reports are triggered and executed within the
                                same process space which also hosts the running web application. This is very common in
                                small to medium size web applications, delivering reports which take longer, than
                                tolerable for a single user request. </p>

                            <p>Also asynchronously periodically generated reports (like static pages of a CMS system or
                                downloadable monthly PDF reports) are usecases for this reporting type. Often it is not
                                needed to run a separate reporting server or running one one would be overkill for the
                                web application installation.</p>

                            <p>As of <tt>Weblets 1.1</tt>
                                support for in server reporting has been added. Currently this feature only works with
                                <tt>Packaged Weblets</tt>
                                . Additional Weblet implementations might be enabled for this feature in future
                                revisions!</p>
                            <img src="../images/2-weblets-reporting-3.png" alt="<i>Figure 3. In Server Reporting</i>
"/></div>
                        <div class="section"><h4>Problem and Solution</h4>

                            <p>This kind of reporting causes one major problem: The reports run most of the times
                                asynchronously, hence there is no servlet API available, although the container itself
                                serves the servlet API!</p>

                            <p><tt>Weblets</tt>
                                adds support via the addition of a <tt>serviceStream</tt>
                                method on the Weblet api level. Additionally on the copy provider level the input chain
                                creation method <tt>wrapInputStream</tt>
                                is provided.</p>

                            <p><tt>Note if you do not program your own Weblets, only the serviceStream method must be a
                                concern to you.</tt>
                            </p>

                            <p>(See <a href="./programmingweblets.html"> Programmers Documentation: Programming
                                Weblets </a>
                                for further reference on both API calls)</p>

                            <p>As we said before only the <tt>serviceStream </tt>
                                method has to be applied internally by the user trying to trigger weblets over
                                asynchronous reporting calls. However, <tt>Weblets</tt>
                                shields the user from the proper application of the entire internal call chain. As
                                usual, a helper method defined in the <tt>WebletUtils</tt>
                                can be called to obtain the proper behavior. </p>

                            <p>Following code example displays how to call apply the Weblets API to asynchronous
                                reporting calls:</p>

                            <div class="source"><pre>
    InputStream istr = WebletUtils.getResourceAsStream(&lt;weblet name&gt;, &lt;resource path&gt;, mimetype);
</pre>
                            </div>
                            <p><i>Code 1: Resource Streaming via weblets</i>
                            </p>

                            <p>Note that in <tt>Weblets 1.1</tt>
                                the mime types still have to be determined manually for the reporting case! This
                                limitation might be removed for later versions!</p>

                            <p>The advantage is, you can get a stream which points to the post processed resource and
                                you can do the processing in your report like you would do with any other datasource.
                                The call can be done outside of a regular request it is not dependent on an actual
                                request being present. However <tt>Weblets</tt>
                                itself must be preinitialized (aka. being started within a web container!)</p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="section"><h3>Reporting Server</h3>

                        <div class="section"><h4>Introduction</h4>

                            <p>A dedicated reporting server is a very common use case for big installations or cluster
                                systems. The idea behind it is to outsource the reporting to a dedicated installation
                                only doing reporting. Advantages of such systems are:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Reporting gets its own process space or even a physical machine and cannot
                                    compromise the other subsystems
                                </li>
                                <li>the processor load is given fully to the web application in case of dedicated
                                    physical reporting servers.<img src="../images/2-weblets-reporting-4.png" alt="<i>Figure 4: Dedicated Reporting Server</i>
"/></li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <div class="section"><h4>Problem and solution</h4>

                            <p>Admittably currently <tt>Weblets</tt>
                                support for this usecase is not very extensive. There are no dedicated helper classes
                                which make things easier for us.</p>

                            <p>But, since <tt>Weblets 1.0</tt>
                                there haven been several constructs in place aiding in the integration of this reporting
                                case, although probably adjustments on the build level are required!</p>

                            <div class="section"><h5>Solution 1, calling the generated URLs directly.</h5>

                                <p>This is arguably the worst solution which can be applied to the above mentioned
                                    problem. Most modern reporting engines have neutral <tt>datasource</tt>
                                    constructs which serve data from any given source. By utilizing those APIs we can
                                    hook into weblets. The probably easiest way is simply to handcode the resource URLs
                                    for the resources hosted on the remote server into our datasource.</p>

                                <p>This method can be used but is error prone. Every version change of your resource
                                    hosting source needs readjustments on the reporting server part! But this solution
                                    is the only viable one, if you cannot alter the web configuration of your reporting
                                    server, or if your reporting server does not run within a web container!</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="section"><h5>Solution 2, utilizing the URL Weblet and dual packaging!</h5>

                                <p>This solution works, if your reporting server runs within the scope of a dedicated
                                    web application and you have write access to the configuration!</p>

                                <p>To overcome the versioning problem we can use the URL Weblet which has been
                                    introduced in <tt>Weblets 1.0</tt>
                                    as proxying mechanism to our resources. This would overcome the problem of code
                                    adjustments. If the source changes its versioning and would push the problem to one
                                    central location, which then can be handled via build processes!</p>

                                <p>What does the URL Weblet do. To sum it up shortly, it is a proxy mechanism which
                                    allows to utilize the <tt>Weblets</tt>
                                    frontend API to gather access to remotely hosted resources. For the application
                                    programmer utilizing this Weblet, it looks exactly like a local one, only the
                                    generated URL patterns redirect to remotely hosted resources!</p>

                                <p>The advantage of this method is, resources can be outsourced to a dedicated resource
                                    serving server, without having to change a single line of code.</p>

                                <p>(See also <a href="./packingweblets.html"> Users Documentation: Weblets Packaging
                                    Guide </a>
                                    for further documentation)</p>

                                <p>So how does this aid in our problem. Very simple we can use this weblet to point
                                    towards anther server delivering our resources. We then can use our frontend APIs to
                                    gain access to the correct resources and then use, the IO and URL apis from java to
                                    get a proper input stream on the resource!</p>

                                <p>By application of this solution we have pushed the entire configuration aspects down
                                    to one single point of configuration which theoretically could be handled by a
                                    centralized build process!</p>

                                <p>The resource post processing done by <tt>Weblets</tt>
                                    can either be handled by the resource server itself (if it utilizes <tt>Weblets</tt>
                                    for its reporting) or by the URL Weblet proxing into the reporting server!</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="section"><h5>Synopsis of both solutions</h5>

                                <p>As we can see neither solution to this problem is ideal, however solution 2 is
                                    recommendable over the direct url generation solution. If you can gain access to the
                                    web configuration and can add <tt>Weblets</tt>
                                    to your reporting server configuration, <b>use the proxying solution</b>
                                    !</p>
